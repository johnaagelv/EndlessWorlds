# World generator for Endless Worlds
The generator makes it easier to build a World consisting of one or more maps, where a map may be whatever you wish it to be!

# Generator build definitions
The build definition is a dictionary of world information and map build instructions.

## World information
The world information are:
- id, unique identified of this world
- name, the name of this world
- entry, is a list of map coordinates where the player may be starting from
- maps, is a list of all the map build instructions

## Map build instructions
The map build instructions each starts with a build instruction number, where:
- 0 is the instruction that defines the map name, size, default tile to use, visibility (known from the start or not), and an optional seed
- 1 is the instruction to build a square/rectangle at coordinates x, y with a width and height, a tile to use, and to fill the square/rectangle or not
- 2 is the instruction to build a circle at coordinates x, y with a radius, a tile to use, to fill it or not, and a thickness used when fill is false
- 3 is the instruction to build an automatic map shifting tile at coordinates x, y, a tile to use, the target coordinates x, y, the altitude, and target map number
- 4 is the instruction to build an action activated map shifting tile at coordinates x, y, a tile to use, the target coordinates x, y, the altitude, target map number, and an action (up/down)
- 5 is the instruction to build an area at coordinates x, y with a width and height, using two or three tiles randomly
- 6 is the instruction to build a trail at coordinates x1, y1 with a target of coordinates x2, y2 and the trail width between two values
- 7 is the instruction to build an area at coordinates x, y with a width and height filled with a specified symbol (ie. a new tile will be created)

Whenever a 0 build instruction number is read, a new map is started and every higher build instruction number is applied to that map.
