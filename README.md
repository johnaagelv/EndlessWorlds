# 1. Endless Worlds
You are invited to join the survey team for planet Ankt in the HR 8799 system located 133 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Pegasus.

Initially 4 massive planets were discovered but later an automatic explorer probe discovered the planet Ankt in the habitable zone of the star.
The report sent back presented a planet very much similar to Earth with a sea/landmass proportion of 50/50, small ice caps in the polar regions, and a
breathable atmosphere!

The team will consist of 100 volunteers from all over the world and each will have the skills needed to survive on a foreign planet ... or die trying.

A spaceship is being constructed to carry the team in suspended animation and carry resources for one year. Within that time the survey team must
establish a self-sustained base of operation.

Travel time to HR 8799 will take less than one year. On arrival the survey team and cargo will be offloaded in a secluded location, preferably near a sea,
after which the spaceship will return to Earth.
