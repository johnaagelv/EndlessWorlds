# 1. Endless Worlds
You are invited to join the surveyor team for planet Ankt in the HR 8799 system located 133 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Pegasus.

Initially 4 massive planets were discovered but later an automatic explorer craft discovered the planet Ankt in the life zone of the star.
The report sent back presented a planet very much similar to Earth with a sea/landmass proportion of 50/50, small ice caps in the polar regions, and a breathable atmosphere!
