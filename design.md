# 1. Introduction
A Roguelike game running a client and connecting to one or more servers.

Each server provides the client with a set of interconnected maps. A server can represent
a world, a continent, a country, an area, a city, a vehicle, a cave tunnel system, a spaceship ... 
you name it!

Each map can not only be interconnected to other maps on the same server, but can also connect to
a map on another server.

With this archictecture, the game may become endless!
